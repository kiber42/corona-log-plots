# Corona Log Figures

Using [COVID-19 data]
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
"Github page from which tables with virus data in csv format can be downloaded")
provided by the John Hopkins University, this script creates some basic figures
(using matplotlib) using a logarithmic scale for the y-axis.

In logarithmic scale, an exponential growth appears as a straight line.
Therefore, changes in the rate of spread of the COVID-19 disease can be seen
more clearly than in the commonly found diagrams in linear scale.

This package contains the plotting code and a selection of figures.  To make
additional figures, you need to checkout the current data from the John Hopkins
University:
    git clone [this]
    cd [this]
    git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git

The numbers are currently updated on a daily basis, retrieve the current data using:
    cd COVID-19
    git pull

To generate figures, run the `time_series.py` script with one or more country
names as arguments.  Without arguments, a figure for my home country Germany is created.
    ./time_series.py US "United Kingdom" Germany China
(The syntax is assuming you're on Linux.)

The figures are displayed on screen, hit `Ctrl+C` on the terminal to close all
at once.
